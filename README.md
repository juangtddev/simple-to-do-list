# To-Do List App

This project is a **To-Do List App** created with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The app allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed or incomplete, and delete tasks. It also uses **Local Storage** to save tasks in the browser, ensuring that tasks persist even after closing and reopening the browser.

## Features

- **Add New Tasks**: Users can add tasks by typing in the input box and clicking the "Add" button. Each new task will appear in the list.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed/Incomplete**: Clicking on a task toggles its status between completed and incomplete.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks from the list by clicking the close (delete) icon next to each task.
- **Persistent Data with Local Storage**: The To-Do list is saved in the browserâ€™s Local Storage, so tasks remain even after closing the browser.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the app.
- **CSS**: For styling the app and making it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: For the app's functionality (adding, toggling, deleting tasks) and managing Local Storage.

## Local Storage Explanation

This app uses the browser's **Local Storage** to store your tasks. This means that even if you close the browser or refresh the page, your task list will still be available when you return to the app.
